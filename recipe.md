Method:
Grease and line the bottom of an 8” square or 9” round cake tin with greaseproof paper/baking parchment/butter paper.
In a mixing bowl, assemble the flour, custard powder or cornstarch, icing sugar,  baking powder and baking soda, mix with a spoon and sieve once to make the mixture uniform.
Preheat the oven at about 150 degrees centigrade.
Put in the condensed milk,  butter, vanilla extract and water or milk into the mixing bowl containing the dry ingredients. Beat with an electric hand mixer, whisk or spoon  until the mixture comes together and there are no lumps. This shouldn’t take more than 2 to 3 minutes with an electric hand mixer/beater. Be careful not to over beat the mixture as this could result into a hard cake.
Pour the batter into the cake tin and bake for an hour at 150 degree centigrade.
The cake is done when a knife or cake tester comes out clean when inserted in the centre of the cake. Invert the cake on a cooling rack, cool and use as required.

Refrigerate the bowl and beater for 15 minutes.
In a saucepan, melt the butter and  3/4 cup cream, stirring all the while until the butter melts completely. Transfer to a heatproof cup or bowl and allow to cool to room temperature.

Beat the remaining cream with sugar until you get soft peaks. Now begin adding the butter in a gradual stream, beating constantly on low speed, until stiff peaks are formed.

Because it was hot and humid I could not get really stiff peaks.
The next time I plan to use 600 ml cream, keeping the other ingredients the same to get a stiffer consistency.
Assemble the cake:
Once the sponge cake has cooled, carefully slice it into two halves. Keep the bottom half on the serving plate and sprinkle with pineapple juice until the entire cake is soaked with it. Spread a little cream over the cake and top with finely cut pieces of pineapple.

Carefully place the other sponge over the prepared cake and sprinkle again with the pineapple juice until the top half is soaked with it.

Spread the cream over the sides and top of the cake with a palette knife and decoratively arrange some pineapple rings over the cake.
Chill for 3 to 4 hours before you serve.
